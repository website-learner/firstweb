<h2 text-decoration=blink> EFFECTIVE TIME MANAGEMENT TIPS FOR STUDENTS </h2>
<b>Create a Master Schedule</b> 
<!change this to heading3/4> 
<p> 
Make a master schedule your child can use to block off time to work on his or her assignments. This will help your child prioritize projects and provide a structure to help keep him or her on track to meet due dates. Use a different color for each subject so your child can follow the schedule quickly and easily.</p>
<b>Use an Agenda</b>
<p margin-top=50>
Help your child look ahead to all upcoming assignments and record the due dates in an agenda. Use the agenda to schedule in TV and computer time too—this will help your child avoid falling into a trap of wasted hours in front of a screen instead of working on assignments.</p>
<b> Eliminate Distractions </b>
<p> Between cell phones, social media, and friends, there are a lot of activities that can distract students from their school work. When it’s time to get down to work, have your child turn off his or her cell phone and sign out of social media accounts. Any time on the master schedule that is dedicated to working on school work should be cell phone and television-free!</p>
